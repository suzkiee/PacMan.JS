# PacMan on Javascript 

# Description
This is by no means the complete game! I was finishing the code that the instructors of my MITxPRO course wrote to make PacMan move and bounce back when he hits the boundaries of the page. 

#RoadMap 
I'd love to make Pacman change directions on the page using the arrow keys.
